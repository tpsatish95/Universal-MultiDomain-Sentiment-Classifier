"The series primarily takes place in a region called the Final Empire on a world called Scadrial. One thousand years before the story begins, the king of the Final Empire, the Lord Ruler, gained access to a divine power at what is called the Well of Ascension.With this power he remade the world and everything in it into its state at the beginning of the first book. In the Final Empire is a territory within the Lord Ruler&rsquo;s empire.of the Central Dominance and the entire Final Empire. Luthadel is the heart of the Lord Ruler&rsquo;s power, as well as the site of his palace, Kredik Shaw. Before the Lord Ruler remade the world, Luthadel was a mountainous region known as Terris. To hide the true location of Old Terris and the Well of Ascension, the Lord Ruler moved the mountains elsewhere and named that region &ldquo;Terris&rdquo; instead. Terris is the ancestral home of the Terris people. It is a mountainous region located north of the Northern Dominance. The Terris Dominance is the only Dominance to retain its original name. It was historically the home of the Well of Ascension. Urteau is a key crossroads city in the Northern Dominance. It was the traditional seat of House Venture although the family is based mainly in the capital. Later it came under the control of a Skaa dominated government led by a man calling himself &lsquo;the Citizen&rsquo;. Urteau is also famous for its canals that mysteriously ran dry. It plays a key role in the third novel. Fadrex City is an important cross roads city in the Western Dominance. Although all cities outside of Luthadel are forbidden from having walls, Fadrex City has a natural rock formation that makes it very defensible. Lord Cett made this city his base after the fall of the Lord Ruler for this very reason.",1
"The Knights Radiant originated through spren copying the abilities which the heralds obtained through their Honorblades. The Knights Radiant gained their power through spren by creating a bond to them, most likely the mentioned &ldquo;Nahel bond&rdquo; that Highprince Dalinar hears during his penultimate vision in the book. The bond gives the spren sentience, while giving the human surgebinding abilities. Two examples are Sylphrena, an Honorspren, that shares a bond with Kaladin, giving him the power to Surgebind, and Shallan, who created a bond with Pattern, a Liespren (Cryptic) to Soulcast. The Knights Radiant lived by their order&rsquo;s Five Ideals, the First Ideal being the same for every order: Life before death, strength before weakness, journey before destination. The other four ideals are different for each order. Towards the end of The Way of Kings, Kaladin utters the Second Ideal for the Order of Windrunners: I will protect those who cannot protect themselves. Near the end of Words of Radiance, Kaladin whispers the Third Ideal for the Order of Windrunners: I will protect even those I hate, so long as it is right.",5
"A darkeye, or peasant, from the nation of Alethkar during the main timeline of the book who is forced to serve on a bridge crew in the army of Highprince Sadeas. Formerly an apprentice learning surgery from his father, and a member of the army of the brightlord Amaram, he hates light-eyes because of Amaram, who betrays him by first allowing his brother to die, and then taking by force the Shardblade Kaladin earns and gives to his men. Kaladin is able to use Stormlight to heal himself and make himself stronger and faster than any normal human being. He is accompanied by an Honorspren named Syl. She came to him because of his innate honor and kindness in the face of the evil and betrayal that seem to surround him. Kaladin\u2019s connection with Syl is what gives him his power with Stormlight; it also gives Syl the level of sentience she possesses.",-1
"A minor lighteyes, or noble, from the nation of Jah Keved. Her family has fallen on hard times after the death of her father. She seeks to be accepted as the ward and student of the scholar Jasnah Kholin, sister to King Elhokar of Alethkar. A skilled artist who can with a single glance remember and recreate a scene with charcoal and paper, she learns that she is able to Soulcast without a Soulcaster, just like Jasnah. Though the beginning of the book has her plotting to steal Jasnah\u2019s Soulcaster to save her family, she has become Jasnah\u2019s true apprentice by the end of the book.",0

"Thank you for viewing my Flickr Site!  All my images are copyrighted but are available for use upon request, and with my consent.\n\nI\'m still relatively new to being behind the camera, but no stranger to being in front of it.  Having grown up with parents who worked as successful professional photographers, there was a spark of inspiration from the beginning.  Cameras were always around during my youth and I became very comfortable with being photographed, early on.  This set me up quite well for my modeling career which has granted me the opportunity to travel and shoot with some extremely gifted and renowned photographers.\n\nI\'m now ready to translate my experiences into something of my own...a blend of my life experiences and influences, thus far.  I\'m very excited to share my vision; how I see the world, with others.  \n\nFlickr has proven to be such a valuable outlet for feedback and inspiration.  I am thrilled to be part of such a creative global community where ideas and encouragement flow.\n\nTestimonials are welcome, but please, please no \'come to our group\' messages without a valid comment.
